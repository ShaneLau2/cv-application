## Challenges
### React?!
This is it. I've been developing my JavaScript skills to build a solid foundation for React but holy cow this is hard to grasp for now.

Every day is a challenge so far... more to come after I google a few more things...

### States

### Passing data between parent components and children

### Creating editing windows (and basically everything else)
